Chapter 3How Markets Work: Knowing This Gives You an Edge This chapter explains how markets work and why markets move the way they do. This will give you a foundation of what is happening behind the scenes. This knowledge will assist you in doing the research you will need in preparing to enter your trading positions. Factors Responsible for Market MovementThe following list is just a small sample of the different factors that cause markets to move. Economic data and indicators: Market moves based on the release of economic data such as GDP, employment, inflation, and others.
Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing, which influences investment and spending. This increases money supply, which has a dramatic effect on market dynamics.
Global events and news: Market fluctuations can result from significant global events and news, such as natural disasters, political upheavals, and trade agreements.
Political and geopolitical developments: Market movements are impacted by political developments within countries and geopolitical relations between nations.
Supply and demand dynamics: Market prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand for goods and services.
Sentiment and investor behavior: Market movements can be influenced by the overall sentiment of investors and their collective actions.
Technological advancements: Technological breakthroughs can disrupt traditional market players and create new opportunities for growth.
Natural disasters and emergencies: Market fluctuations can occur as a result of natural disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics.
Central bank policies: Central banks can influence market movements through their monetary policies, such as setting interest rates or printing money.
Competition and market saturation: Market movements can be affected by competition within industries and the saturation of particular markets.
Emotions of traders: Fear and greed are massive factors that cause market movements. It is challenging to fully understand why markets move, as there are multiple factors at play, some of which may be unknown or unpredictable. Market movements are influenced by a combination of economic, political, social, and psychological factors, as well as by sudden events such as natural disasters or global emergencies.
Additionally, investor sentiment and behavior play a significant role in market movements, and it can be difficult to predict how individual investors or groups of investors will react in any given situation. Therefore, while it is possible to analyze and understand the general influences on market movements, it is impossible to predict with certainty why markets move.
Most traders do not learn about market mechanics in depth; by reading and understanding this chapter you will have an edge. In Chapter 1 I mentioned that one of the biggest obstacles traders face is thinking that they only need to know strategy and thus leave out many other important parts of market dynamics. This is a massive error in thinking and because of this most traders never learn the fundamental reason markets move the way they do.
We see “candles” on charts. We know that prices are going up or down, but we do not understand why or how these prices move. What makes a stock go down in value and how does it work?
I am going to share a concept that I first learned from Lance Beggs in YTC Price Action Trader1 that has been extremely helpful to me. Lance explains that the markets are moved by many factors that we cannot see. Things happen behind the scenes that we are not aware of. In fact, we only see the effect of market movements; we do not see the cause. We have an incomplete picture of the markets, and no matter how much information we have, we will never get the complete picture of why a market is moving.
Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.
Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see.
The fire, or human-made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.
Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light….2 There are too many people and circumstances involved in what moves a market, and when we begin to understand and accept this reality, we become equipped to learn how to profit from the markets.
There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities. We take the best trade we can and use money management techniques to give us a trading edge. How Emotions Move Markets
I have discovered that having a strong understanding of the markets behind the scenes makes a big difference in how I look at trading and therefore has improved my trading performance.
The market movements we see happening on charts are caused by people buying and selling behind the scenes. All we see are prices going up or going down.
The market will not always make sense because it is being led by emotions. If you want to profit on a consistent basis, you must understand this: humans are led by emotions, and those emotions can cause the price of whatever you are trading to be very volatile—prices moving rapidly in multiple directions without a clearly identifiable reason.
Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account. Day Trading Disaster I didn't have any day trading experience when I first attempted to day trade in 2008, but I needed money. Earlier in this book I said needing money is a dangerous place to begin learning to trade because you have other financial problems that you need to learn to solve. Learning to trade is an important financial problem that you can learn to solve. If you believe it will be a way to get you out of your situation, you are mistaken.
However, I did not understand that truth at that early point in my trading career.
I started with a small $50 account using a strategy and style of trading that I learned from my first mentor, Michael Storm.
The strategy was excellent, and I was having a lot of early success. The problem is that I didn't understand trading emotions and how that moved markets and how my own trading emotions would motivate me to make trades.
This $50 kept growing despite my inexperience. I kept taking bigger risks and making more money. In a short period of time I had grown this $50 account to over $3,500!
I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.
That traumatic event was also my anchor for future success. Because even though it was devastating to me, I never forgot how I made that $3,500, and I always believed that if I did it once, I could do it again. That kept me going, always pushing forward. I also knew that the massive loss was because of my own reckless trading and did not have anything to do with the markets.
Despite the hard times, that memory of making that money allowed me to never quit. My friend and trading mentor Kevin Pyne from TradingBuddySystem.com, whom I interviewed on the How to Trade It podcast, taught me a great way to handle my emotions. He created a chart called the emotion tracker.3
Kevin explains that emotions can swing wildly, and we must be aware of them in our trading. He outlines these in Figure 3.1.
Each day before you trade, during trading, and after you trade you can review this chart and write down the words that describe what you are feeling. Then make sure you are not allowing these emotions to carry into your trades for that day. If you trade with your emotions, you will be erratic and you will be up and down in your trading, eventually causing failure. Figure 3.1 Emotions to Be Aware Of
SOURCE: TradingBuddySystem.com. The entire purpose of this is to help you understand that the market is moved by emotion and crowd mentality and if you understand this and you do not trade like the rest of the market, you will have a massive edge in your trading. Trapped Traders
One way to get an edge in trading is to think about what other traders are experiencing in the market. As we understand fear, greed, euphoria, and pain, we know that these are the real market movers. A sudden reversal at a key level can mean that there are trapped traders.
Trapped traders are traders who get into a trade because they think the market is breaking out, but instead of a breakout the market reverses and traps traders in a losing position. How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.
But not you! Because you have read this book and are working on your market mindset, you will be ready each day to approach the markets with level-headed trading tactics. Figure 3.2 Traders Enter on a Breakout but Get Trapped
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Markets Are Moved by Supply and Demand
Supply and demand is a natural law that is always true in nature. This law is what causes prices to move in the markets. If we understand how this works, it will enable us to get a better grasp on market movement, making us better and more accurate traders.
Specifically, “supply and demand” refers to the amount of goods and services available for people to buy, compared to the amount of goods and services people want to buy. If less of a product than the public wants is produced, the law of supply and demand says that more can be charged for the product. In other words, supply is the amount that is available. Demand is the desire for the product or service and the amount that people are willing to pay for it.
We see supply and demand happen all the time in our economy. In the documentary The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Episode 1: Sneakers,4 Jeff goes to Sneaker Con, a massive market for sneaker fanatics.
During the episode he shows what a massive demand can do to raise sneaker prices. A normal pair of shoes averages less than $100 a pair, but at this convention there are shoes that have massive resale value because of supply and demand—certain shoes are in limited supply combined with people who have money and are willing to pay. At the 2022 Sneaker Con there is a pair of Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force One that has an average resale price of $126,500.5
Supply and demand has always been the driving factor for price movements. Looking back in time, we can see the famous Dutch Tulip Market Bubble. This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes

Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”

I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.
That traumatic event was also my anchor for future success. Because even though it was devastating to me, I never forgot how I made that $3,500, and I always believed that if I did it once, I could do it again. That kept me going, always pushing forward. I also knew that the massive loss was because of my own reckless trading and did not have anything to do with the markets.
Despite the hard times, that memory of making that money allowed me to never quit. My friend and trading mentor Kevin Pyne from TradingBuddySystem.com, whom I interviewed on the How to Trade It podcast, taught me a great way to handle my emotions. He created a chart called the emotion tracker.3
Kevin explains that emotions can swing wildly, and we must be aware of them in our trading. He outlines these in Figure 3.1.
Each day before you trade, during trading, and after you trade you can review this chart and write down the words that describe what you are feeling. Then make sure you are not allowing these emotions to carry into your trades for that day. If you trade with your emotions, you will be erratic and you will be up and down in your trading, eventually causing failure. Figure 3.1 Emotions to Be Aware Of
SOURCE: TradingBuddySystem.com. The entire purpose of this is to help you understand that the market is moved by emotion and crowd mentality and if you understand this and you do not trade like the rest of the market, you will have a massive edge in your trading. Trapped Traders
One way to get an edge in trading is to think about what other traders are experiencing in the market. As we understand fear, greed, euphoria, and pain, we know that these are the real market movers. A sudden reversal at a key level can mean that there are trapped traders.
Trapped traders are traders who get into a trade because they think the market is breaking out, but instead of a breakout the market reverses and traps traders in a losing position. How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.
But not you! Because you have read this book and are working on your market mindset, you will be ready each day to approach the markets with level-headed trading tactics. Figure 3.2 Traders Enter on a Breakout but Get Trapped
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Markets Are Moved by Supply and Demand
Supply and demand is a natural law that is always true in nature. This law is what causes prices to move in the markets. If we understand how this works, it will enable us to get a better grasp on market movement, making us better and more accurate traders.
Specifically, “supply and demand” refers to the amount of goods and services available for people to buy, compared to the amount of goods and services people want to buy. If less of a product than the public wants is produced, the law of supply and demand says that more can be charged for the product. In other words, supply is the amount that is available. Demand is the desire for the product or service and the amount that people are willing to pay for it.
We see supply and demand happen all the time in our economy. In the documentary The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Episode 1: Sneakers,4 Jeff goes to Sneaker Con, a massive market for sneaker fanatics.
During the episode he shows what a massive demand can do to raise sneaker prices. A normal pair of shoes averages less than $100 a pair, but at this convention there are shoes that have massive resale value because of supply and demand—certain shoes are in limited supply combined with people who have money and are willing to pay. At the 2022 Sneaker Con there is a pair of Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force One that has an average resale price of $126,500.5
Supply and demand has always been the driving factor for price movements. Looking back in time, we can see the famous Dutch Tulip Market Bubble. This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes

Chapter 3How Markets Work: Knowing This Gives You an Edge This chapter explains how markets work and why markets move the way they do. This will give you a foundation of what is happening behind the scenes. This knowledge will assist you in doing the research you will need in preparing to enter your trading positions. Factors Responsible for Market MovementThe following list is just a small sample of the different factors that cause markets to move. Economic data and indicators: Market moves based on the release of economic data such as GDP, employment, inflation, and others.
Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing, which influences investment and spending. This increases money supply, which has a dramatic effect on market dynamics.
Global events and news: Market fluctuations can result from significant global events and news, such as natural disasters, political upheavals, and trade agreements.
Political and geopolitical developments: Market movements are impacted by political developments within countries and geopolitical relations between nations.
Supply and demand dynamics: Market prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand for goods and services.
Sentiment and investor behavior: Market movements can be influenced by the overall sentiment of investors and their collective actions.
Technological advancements: Technological breakthroughs can disrupt traditional market players and create new opportunities for growth.
Natural disasters and emergencies: Market fluctuations can occur as a result of natural disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics.
Central bank policies: Central banks can influence market movements through their monetary policies, such as setting interest rates or printing money.
Competition and market saturation: Market movements can be affected by competition within industries and the saturation of particular markets.
Emotions of traders: Fear and greed are massive factors that cause market movements. It is challenging to fully understand why markets move, as there are multiple factors at play, some of which may be unknown or unpredictable. Market movements are influenced by a combination of economic, political, social, and psychological factors, as well as by sudden events such as natural disasters or global emergencies.
Additionally, investor sentiment and behavior play a significant role in market movements, and it can be difficult to predict how individual investors or groups of investors will react in any given situation. Therefore, while it is possible to analyze and understand the general influences on market movements, it is impossible to predict with certainty why markets move.
Most traders do not learn about market mechanics in depth; by reading and understanding this chapter you will have an edge. In Chapter 1 I mentioned that one of the biggest obstacles traders face is thinking that they only need to know strategy and thus leave out many other important parts of market dynamics. This is a massive error in thinking and because of this most traders never learn the fundamental reason markets move the way they do.
We see “candles” on charts. We know that prices are going up or down, but we do not understand why or how these prices move. What makes a stock go down in value and how does it work?
I am going to share a concept that I first learned from Lance Beggs in YTC Price Action Trader1 that has been extremely helpful to me. Lance explains that the markets are moved by many factors that we cannot see. Things happen behind the scenes that we are not aware of. In fact, we only see the effect of market movements; we do not see the cause. We have an incomplete picture of the markets, and no matter how much information we have, we will never get the complete picture of why a market is moving.
Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.
Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see.
The fire, or human-made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.
Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light….2 There are too many people and circumstances involved in what moves a market, and when we begin to understand and accept this reality, we become equipped to learn how to profit from the markets.
There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities. We take the best trade we can and use money management techniques to give us a trading edge. How Emotions Move Markets
I have discovered that having a strong understanding of the markets behind the scenes makes a big difference in how I look at trading and therefore has improved my trading performance.
The market movements we see happening on charts are caused by people buying and selling behind the scenes. All we see are prices going up or going down.
The market will not always make sense because it is being led by emotions. If you want to profit on a consistent basis, you must understand this: humans are led by emotions, and those emotions can cause the price of whatever you are trading to be very volatile—prices moving rapidly in multiple directions without a clearly identifiable reason.
Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account. Day Trading Disaster I didn't have any day trading experience when I first attempted to day trade in 2008, but I needed money. Earlier in this book I said needing money is a dangerous place to begin learning to trade because you have other financial problems that you need to learn to solve. Learning to trade is an important financial problem that you can learn to solve. If you believe it will be a way to get you out of your situation, you are mistaken.
However, I did not understand that truth at that early point in my trading career.
I started with a small $50 account using a strategy and style of trading that I learned from my first mentor, Michael Storm.
The strategy was excellent, and I was having a lot of early success. The problem is that I didn't understand trading emotions and how that moved markets and how my own trading emotions would motivate me to make trades.
This $50 kept growing despite my inexperience. I kept taking bigger risks and making more money. In a short period of time I had grown this $50 account to over $3,500!
I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.

At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes

Chapter 3How Markets Work: Knowing This Gives You an Edge This chapter explains how markets work and why markets move the way they do. This will give you a foundation of what is happening behind the scenes. This knowledge will assist you in doing the research you will need in preparing to enter your trading positions. Factors Responsible for Market MovementThe following list is just a small sample of the different factors that cause markets to move. Economic data and indicators: Market moves based on the release of economic data such as GDP, employment, inflation, and others.
Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing, which influences investment and spending. This increases money supply, which has a dramatic effect on market dynamics.
Global events and news: Market fluctuations can result from significant global events and news, such as natural disasters, political upheavals, and trade agreements.
Political and geopolitical developments: Market movements are impacted by political developments within countries and geopolitical relations between nations.
Supply and demand dynamics: Market prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand for goods and services.
Sentiment and investor behavior: Market movements can be influenced by the overall sentiment of investors and their collective actions.
Technological advancements: Technological breakthroughs can disrupt traditional market players and create new opportunities for growth.
Natural disasters and emergencies: Market fluctuations can occur as a result of natural disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics.
Central bank policies: Central banks can influence market movements through their monetary policies, such as setting interest rates or printing money.
Competition and market saturation: Market movements can be affected by competition within industries and the saturation of particular markets.
Emotions of traders: Fear and greed are massive factors that cause market movements. It is challenging to fully understand why markets move, as there are multiple factors at play, some of which may be unknown or unpredictable. Market movements are influenced by a combination of economic, political, social, and psychological factors, as well as by sudden events such as natural disasters or global emergencies.
Additionally, investor sentiment and behavior play a significant role in market movements, and it can be difficult to predict how individual investors or groups of investors will react in any given situation. Therefore, while it is possible to analyze and understand the general influences on market movements, it is impossible to predict with certainty why markets move.
Most traders do not learn about market mechanics in depth; by reading and understanding this chapter you will have an edge. In Chapter 1 I mentioned that one of the biggest obstacles traders face is thinking that they only need to know strategy and thus leave out many other important parts of market dynamics. This is a massive error in thinking and because of this most traders never learn the fundamental reason markets move the way they do.
We see “candles” on charts. We know that prices are going up or down, but we do not understand why or how these prices move. What makes a stock go down in value and how does it work?
I am going to share a concept that I first learned from Lance Beggs in YTC Price Action Trader1 that has been extremely helpful to me. Lance explains that the markets are moved by many factors that we cannot see. Things happen behind the scenes that we are not aware of. In fact, we only see the effect of market movements; we do not see the cause. We have an incomplete picture of the markets, and no matter how much information we have, we will never get the complete picture of why a market is moving.
Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.
Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see.
The fire, or human-made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.
Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light….2 There are too many people and circumstances involved in what moves a market, and when we begin to understand and accept this reality, we become equipped to learn how to profit from the markets.
There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities. We take the best trade we can and use money management techniques to give us a trading edge. How Emotions Move Markets
I have discovered that having a strong understanding of the markets behind the scenes makes a big difference in how I look at trading and therefore has improved my trading performance.
The market movements we see happening on charts are caused by people buying and selling behind the scenes. All we see are prices going up or going down.
The market will not always make sense because it is being led by emotions. If you want to profit on a consistent basis, you must understand this: humans are led by emotions, and those emotions can cause the price of whatever you are trading to be very volatile—prices moving rapidly in multiple directions without a clearly identifiable reason.
Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account. Day Trading Disaster I didn't have any day trading experience when I first attempted to day trade in 2008, but I needed money. Earlier in this book I said needing money is a dangerous place to begin learning to trade because you have other financial problems that you need to learn to solve. Learning to trade is an important financial problem that you can learn to solve. If you believe it will be a way to get you out of your situation, you are mistaken.
However, I did not understand that truth at that early point in my trading career.
I started with a small $50 account using a strategy and style of trading that I learned from my first mentor, Michael Storm.
The strategy was excellent, and I was having a lot of early success. The problem is that I didn't understand trading emotions and how that moved markets and how my own trading emotions would motivate me to make trades.
This $50 kept growing despite my inexperience. I kept taking bigger risks and making more money. In a short period of time I had grown this $50 account to over $3,500!
I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.
That traumatic event was also my anchor for future success. Because even though it was devastating to me, I never forgot how I made that $3,500, and I always believed that if I did it once, I could do it again. That kept me going, always pushing forward. I also knew that the massive loss was because of my own reckless trading and did not have anything to do with the markets.
Despite the hard times, that memory of making that money allowed me to never quit. My friend and trading mentor Kevin Pyne from TradingBuddySystem.com, whom I interviewed on the How to Trade It podcast, taught me a great way to handle my emotions. He created a chart called the emotion tracker.3
Kevin explains that emotions can swing wildly, and we must be aware of them in our trading. He outlines these in Figure 3.1.
Each day before you trade, during trading, and after you trade you can review this chart and write down the words that describe what you are feeling. Then make sure you are not allowing these emotions to carry into your trades for that day. If you trade with your emotions, you will be erratic and you will be up and down in your trading, eventually causing failure. Figure 3.1 Emotions to Be Aware Of
SOURCE: TradingBuddySystem.com. The entire purpose of this is to help you understand that the market is moved by emotion and crowd mentality and if you understand this and you do not trade like the rest of the market, you will have a massive edge in your trading. Trapped Traders
One way to get an edge in trading is to think about what other traders are experiencing in the market. As we understand fear, greed, euphoria, and pain, we know that these are the real market movers. A sudden reversal at a key level can mean that there are trapped traders.
Trapped traders are traders who get into a trade because they think the market is breaking out, but instead of a breakout the market reverses and traps traders in a losing position. How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.
But not you! Because you have read this book and are working on your market mindset, you will be ready each day to approach the markets with level-headed trading tactics. Figure 3.2 Traders Enter on a Breakout but Get Trapped
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Markets Are Moved by Supply and Demand
Supply and demand is a natural law that is always true in nature. This law is what causes prices to move in the markets. If we understand how this works, it will enable us to get a better grasp on market movement, making us better and more accurate traders.
Specifically, “supply and demand” refers to the amount of goods and services available for people to buy, compared to the amount of goods and services people want to buy. If less of a product than the public wants is produced, the law of supply and demand says that more can be charged for the product. In other words, supply is the amount that is available. Demand is the desire for the product or service and the amount that people are willing to pay for it.
We see supply and demand happen all the time in our economy. In the documentary The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Episode 1: Sneakers,4 Jeff goes to Sneaker Con, a massive market for sneaker fanatics.
During the episode he shows what a massive demand can do to raise sneaker prices. A normal pair of shoes averages less than $100 a pair, but at this convention there are shoes that have massive resale value because of supply and demand—certain shoes are in limited supply combined with people who have money and are willing to pay. At the 2022 Sneaker Con there is a pair of Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force One that has an average resale price of $126,500.5
Supply and demand has always been the driving factor for price movements. Looking back in time, we can see the famous Dutch Tulip Market Bubble. This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?

Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized.

Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.
Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see.
The fire, or human-made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.
Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light….2 There are too many people and circumstances involved in what moves a market, and when we begin to understand and accept this reality, we become equipped to learn how to profit from the markets.
There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities. We take the best trade we can and use money management techniques to give us a trading edge. How Emotions Move Markets
I have discovered that having a strong understanding of the markets behind the scenes makes a big difference in how I look at trading and therefore has improved my trading performance.
The market movements we see happening on charts are caused by people buying and selling behind the scenes. All we see are prices going up or going down.
The market will not always make sense because it is being led by emotions. If you want to profit on a consistent basis, you must understand this: humans are led by emotions, and those emotions can cause the price of whatever you are trading to be very volatile—prices moving rapidly in multiple directions without a clearly identifiable reason.
Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account. Day Trading Disaster I didn't have any day trading experience when I first attempted to day trade in 2008, but I needed money. Earlier in this book I said needing money is a dangerous place to begin learning to trade because you have other financial problems that you need to learn to solve. Learning to trade is an important financial problem that you can learn to solve. If you believe it will be a way to get you out of your situation, you are mistaken.
However, I did not understand that truth at that early point in my trading career.
I started with a small $50 account using a strategy and style of trading that I learned from my first mentor, Michael Storm.
The strategy was excellent, and I was having a lot of early success. The problem is that I didn't understand trading emotions and how that moved markets and how my own trading emotions would motivate me to make trades.
This $50 kept growing despite my inexperience. I kept taking bigger risks and making more money. In a short period of time I had grown this $50 account to over $3,500!
I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.
That traumatic event was also my anchor for future success. Because even though it was devastating to me, I never forgot how I made that $3,500, and I always believed that if I did it once, I could do it again. That kept me going, always pushing forward. I also knew that the massive loss was because of my own reckless trading and did not have anything to do with the markets.
Despite the hard times, that memory of making that money allowed me to never quit. My friend and trading mentor Kevin Pyne from TradingBuddySystem.com, whom I interviewed on the How to Trade It podcast, taught me a great way to handle my emotions. He created a chart called the emotion tracker.3
Kevin explains that emotions can swing wildly, and we must be aware of them in our trading. He outlines these in Figure 3.1.
Each day before you trade, during trading, and after you trade you can review this chart and write down the words that describe what you are feeling. Then make sure you are not allowing these emotions to carry into your trades for that day. If you trade with your emotions, you will be erratic and you will be up and down in your trading, eventually causing failure. Figure 3.1 Emotions to Be Aware Of
SOURCE: TradingBuddySystem.com. The entire purpose of this is to help you understand that the market is moved by emotion and crowd mentality and if you understand this and you do not trade like the rest of the market, you will have a massive edge in your trading. Trapped Traders
One way to get an edge in trading is to think about what other traders are experiencing in the market. As we understand fear, greed, euphoria, and pain, we know that these are the real market movers. A sudden reversal at a key level can mean that there are trapped traders.
Trapped traders are traders who get into a trade because they think the market is breaking out, but instead of a breakout the market reverses and traps traders in a losing position. How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.
But not you! Because you have read this book and are working on your market mindset, you will be ready each day to approach the markets with level-headed trading tactics. Figure 3.2 Traders Enter on a Breakout but Get Trapped
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Markets Are Moved by Supply and Demand
Supply and demand is a natural law that is always true in nature. This law is what causes prices to move in the markets. If we understand how this works, it will enable us to get a better grasp on market movement, making us better and more accurate traders.
Specifically, “supply and demand” refers to the amount of goods and services available for people to buy, compared to the amount of goods and services people want to buy. If less of a product than the public wants is produced, the law of supply and demand says that more can be charged for the product. In other words, supply is the amount that is available. Demand is the desire for the product or service and the amount that people are willing to pay for it.
We see supply and demand happen all the time in our economy. In the documentary The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Episode 1: Sneakers,4 Jeff goes to Sneaker Con, a massive market for sneaker fanatics.
During the episode he shows what a massive demand can do to raise sneaker prices. A normal pair of shoes averages less than $100 a pair, but at this convention there are shoes that have massive resale value because of supply and demand—certain shoes are in limited supply combined with people who have money and are willing to pay. At the 2022 Sneaker Con there is a pair of Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force One that has an average resale price of $126,500.5
Supply and demand has always been the driving factor for price movements. Looking back in time, we can see the famous Dutch Tulip Market Bubble. This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes

Chapter 3How Markets Work: Knowing This Gives You an Edge This chapter explains how markets work and why markets move the way they do. This will give you a foundation of what is happening behind the scenes. This knowledge will assist you in doing the research you will need in preparing to enter your trading positions. Factors Responsible for Market MovementThe following list is just a small sample of the different factors that cause markets to move. Economic data and indicators: Market moves based on the release of economic data such as GDP, employment, inflation, and others.
Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing, which influences investment and spending. This increases money supply, which has a dramatic effect on market dynamics.
Global events and news: Market fluctuations can result from significant global events and news, such as natural disasters, political upheavals, and trade agreements.
Political and geopolitical developments: Market movements are impacted by political developments within countries and geopolitical relations between nations.
Supply and demand dynamics: Market prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand for goods and services.
Sentiment and investor behavior: Market movements can be influenced by the overall sentiment of investors and their collective actions.
Technological advancements: Technological breakthroughs can disrupt traditional market players and create new opportunities for growth.
Natural disasters and emergencies: Market fluctuations can occur as a result of natural disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics.
Central bank policies: Central banks can influence market movements through their monetary policies, such as setting interest rates or printing money.
Competition and market saturation: Market movements can be affected by competition within industries and the saturation of particular markets.
Emotions of traders: Fear and greed are massive factors that cause market movements. It is challenging to fully understand why markets move, as there are multiple factors at play, some of which may be unknown or unpredictable. Market movements are influenced by a combination of economic, political, social, and psychological factors, as well as by sudden events such as natural disasters or global emergencies.
Additionally, investor sentiment and behavior play a significant role in market movements, and it can be difficult to predict how individual investors or groups of investors will react in any given situation. Therefore, while it is possible to analyze and understand the general influences on market movements, it is impossible to predict with certainty why markets move.
Most traders do not learn about market mechanics in depth; by reading and understanding this chapter you will have an edge. In Chapter 1 I mentioned that one of the biggest obstacles traders face is thinking that they only need to know strategy and thus leave out many other important parts of market dynamics. This is a massive error in thinking and because of this most traders never learn the fundamental reason markets move the way they do.
We see “candles” on charts. We know that prices are going up or down, but we do not understand why or how these prices move. What makes a stock go down in value and how does it work?
I am going to share a concept that I first learned from Lance Beggs in YTC Price Action Trader1 that has been extremely helpful to me. Lance explains that the markets are moved by many factors that we cannot see. Things happen behind the scenes that we are not aware of. In fact, we only see the effect of market movements; we do not see the cause. We have an incomplete picture of the markets, and no matter how much information we have, we will never get the complete picture of why a market is moving.
Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them.

There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities.

How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.
But not you! Because you have read this book and are working on your market mindset, you will be ready each day to approach the markets with level-headed trading tactics. Figure 3.2 Traders Enter on a Breakout but Get Trapped
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Markets Are Moved by Supply and Demand
Supply and demand is a natural law that is always true in nature. This law is what causes prices to move in the markets. If we understand how this works, it will enable us to get a better grasp on market movement, making us better and more accurate traders.
Specifically, “supply and demand” refers to the amount of goods and services available for people to buy, compared to the amount of goods and services people want to buy. If less of a product than the public wants is produced, the law of supply and demand says that more can be charged for the product. In other words, supply is the amount that is available. Demand is the desire for the product or service and the amount that people are willing to pay for it.
We see supply and demand happen all the time in our economy. In the documentary The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Episode 1: Sneakers,4 Jeff goes to Sneaker Con, a massive market for sneaker fanatics.
During the episode he shows what a massive demand can do to raise sneaker prices. A normal pair of shoes averages less than $100 a pair, but at this convention there are shoes that have massive resale value because of supply and demand—certain shoes are in limited supply combined with people who have money and are willing to pay. At the 2022 Sneaker Con there is a pair of Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force One that has an average resale price of $126,500.5
Supply and demand has always been the driving factor for price movements. Looking back in time, we can see the famous Dutch Tulip Market Bubble. This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes

Chapter 3How Markets Work: Knowing This Gives You an Edge This chapter explains how markets work and why markets move the way they do. This will give you a foundation of what is happening behind the scenes. This knowledge will assist you in doing the research you will need in preparing to enter your trading positions. Factors Responsible for Market MovementThe following list is just a small sample of the different factors that cause markets to move. Economic data and indicators: Market moves based on the release of economic data such as GDP, employment, inflation, and others.
Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing, which influences investment and spending. This increases money supply, which has a dramatic effect on market dynamics.
Global events and news: Market fluctuations can result from significant global events and news, such as natural disasters, political upheavals, and trade agreements.
Political and geopolitical developments: Market movements are impacted by political developments within countries and geopolitical relations between nations.
Supply and demand dynamics: Market prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand for goods and services.
Sentiment and investor behavior: Market movements can be influenced by the overall sentiment of investors and their collective actions.
Technological advancements: Technological breakthroughs can disrupt traditional market players and create new opportunities for growth.
Natural disasters and emergencies: Market fluctuations can occur as a result of natural disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics.
Central bank policies: Central banks can influence market movements through their monetary policies, such as setting interest rates or printing money.
Competition and market saturation: Market movements can be affected by competition within industries and the saturation of particular markets.
Emotions of traders: Fear and greed are massive factors that cause market movements. It is challenging to fully understand why markets move, as there are multiple factors at play, some of which may be unknown or unpredictable. Market movements are influenced by a combination of economic, political, social, and psychological factors, as well as by sudden events such as natural disasters or global emergencies.
Additionally, investor sentiment and behavior play a significant role in market movements, and it can be difficult to predict how individual investors or groups of investors will react in any given situation. Therefore, while it is possible to analyze and understand the general influences on market movements, it is impossible to predict with certainty why markets move.
Most traders do not learn about market mechanics in depth; by reading and understanding this chapter you will have an edge. In Chapter 1 I mentioned that one of the biggest obstacles traders face is thinking that they only need to know strategy and thus leave out many other important parts of market dynamics. This is a massive error in thinking and because of this most traders never learn the fundamental reason markets move the way they do.
We see “candles” on charts. We know that prices are going up or down, but we do not understand why or how these prices move. What makes a stock go down in value and how does it work?
I am going to share a concept that I first learned from Lance Beggs in YTC Price Action Trader1 that has been extremely helpful to me. Lance explains that the markets are moved by many factors that we cannot see. Things happen behind the scenes that we are not aware of. In fact, we only see the effect of market movements; we do not see the cause. We have an incomplete picture of the markets, and no matter how much information we have, we will never get the complete picture of why a market is moving.
Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.
Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see.
The fire, or human-made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.
Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light….2 There are too many people and circumstances involved in what moves a market, and when we begin to understand and accept this reality, we become equipped to learn how to profit from the markets.
There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities. We take the best trade we can and use money management techniques to give us a trading edge. How Emotions Move Markets
I have discovered that having a strong understanding of the markets behind the scenes makes a big difference in how I look at trading and therefore has improved my trading performance.
The market movements we see happening on charts are caused by people buying and selling behind the scenes. All we see are prices going up or going down.
The market will not always make sense because it is being led by emotions. If you want to profit on a consistent basis, you must understand this: humans are led by emotions, and those emotions can cause the price of whatever you are trading to be very volatile—prices moving rapidly in multiple directions without a clearly identifiable reason.
Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account. Day Trading Disaster I didn't have any day trading experience when I first attempted to day trade in 2008, but I needed money. Earlier in this book I said needing money is a dangerous place to begin learning to trade because you have other financial problems that you need to learn to solve. Learning to trade is an important financial problem that you can learn to solve. If you believe it will be a way to get you out of your situation, you are mistaken.
However, I did not understand that truth at that early point in my trading career.
I started with a small $50 account using a strategy and style of trading that I learned from my first mentor, Michael Storm.
The strategy was excellent, and I was having a lot of early success. The problem is that I didn't understand trading emotions and how that moved markets and how my own trading emotions would motivate me to make trades.
This $50 kept growing despite my inexperience. I kept taking bigger risks and making more money. In a short period of time I had grown this $50 account to over $3,500!
I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.
That traumatic event was also my anchor for future success. Because even though it was devastating to me, I never forgot how I made that $3,500, and I always believed that if I did it once, I could do it again. That kept me going, always pushing forward. I also knew that the massive loss was because of my own reckless trading and did not have anything to do with the markets.
Despite the hard times, that memory of making that money allowed me to never quit. My friend and trading mentor Kevin Pyne from TradingBuddySystem.com, whom I interviewed on the How to Trade It podcast, taught me a great way to handle my emotions. He created a chart called the emotion tracker.3
Kevin explains that emotions can swing wildly, and we must be aware of them in our trading. He outlines these in Figure 3.1.
Each day before you trade, during trading, and after you trade you can review this chart and write down the words that describe what you are feeling. Then make sure you are not allowing these emotions to carry into your trades for that day. If you trade with your emotions, you will be erratic and you will be up and down in your trading, eventually causing failure. Figure 3.1 Emotions to Be Aware Of
SOURCE: TradingBuddySystem.com. The entire purpose of this is to help you understand that the market is moved by emotion and crowd mentality and if you understand this and you do not trade like the rest of the market, you will have a massive edge in your trading. Trapped Traders
One way to get an edge in trading is to think about what other traders are experiencing in the market. As we understand fear, greed, euphoria, and pain, we know that these are the real market movers. A sudden reversal at a key level can mean that there are trapped traders.
Trapped traders are traders who get into a trade because they think the market is breaking out, but instead of a breakout the market reverses and traps traders in a losing position. How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.

This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes

Chapter 3How Markets Work: Knowing This Gives You an Edge This chapter explains how markets work and why markets move the way they do. This will give you a foundation of what is happening behind the scenes. This knowledge will assist you in doing the research you will need in preparing to enter your trading positions. Factors Responsible for Market MovementThe following list is just a small sample of the different factors that cause markets to move. Economic data and indicators: Market moves based on the release of economic data such as GDP, employment, inflation, and others.
Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing, which influences investment and spending. This increases money supply, which has a dramatic effect on market dynamics.
Global events and news: Market fluctuations can result from significant global events and news, such as natural disasters, political upheavals, and trade agreements.
Political and geopolitical developments: Market movements are impacted by political developments within countries and geopolitical relations between nations.
Supply and demand dynamics: Market prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand for goods and services.
Sentiment and investor behavior: Market movements can be influenced by the overall sentiment of investors and their collective actions.
Technological advancements: Technological breakthroughs can disrupt traditional market players and create new opportunities for growth.
Natural disasters and emergencies: Market fluctuations can occur as a result of natural disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics.
Central bank policies: Central banks can influence market movements through their monetary policies, such as setting interest rates or printing money.
Competition and market saturation: Market movements can be affected by competition within industries and the saturation of particular markets.
Emotions of traders: Fear and greed are massive factors that cause market movements. It is challenging to fully understand why markets move, as there are multiple factors at play, some of which may be unknown or unpredictable. Market movements are influenced by a combination of economic, political, social, and psychological factors, as well as by sudden events such as natural disasters or global emergencies.
Additionally, investor sentiment and behavior play a significant role in market movements, and it can be difficult to predict how individual investors or groups of investors will react in any given situation. Therefore, while it is possible to analyze and understand the general influences on market movements, it is impossible to predict with certainty why markets move.
Most traders do not learn about market mechanics in depth; by reading and understanding this chapter you will have an edge. In Chapter 1 I mentioned that one of the biggest obstacles traders face is thinking that they only need to know strategy and thus leave out many other important parts of market dynamics. This is a massive error in thinking and because of this most traders never learn the fundamental reason markets move the way they do.
We see “candles” on charts. We know that prices are going up or down, but we do not understand why or how these prices move. What makes a stock go down in value and how does it work?
I am going to share a concept that I first learned from Lance Beggs in YTC Price Action Trader1 that has been extremely helpful to me. Lance explains that the markets are moved by many factors that we cannot see. Things happen behind the scenes that we are not aware of. In fact, we only see the effect of market movements; we do not see the cause. We have an incomplete picture of the markets, and no matter how much information we have, we will never get the complete picture of why a market is moving.
Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.
Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see.
The fire, or human-made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.
Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light….2 There are too many people and circumstances involved in what moves a market, and when we begin to understand and accept this reality, we become equipped to learn how to profit from the markets.
There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities. We take the best trade we can and use money management techniques to give us a trading edge. How Emotions Move Markets
I have discovered that having a strong understanding of the markets behind the scenes makes a big difference in how I look at trading and therefore has improved my trading performance.
The market movements we see happening on charts are caused by people buying and selling behind the scenes. All we see are prices going up or going down.
The market will not always make sense because it is being led by emotions. If you want to profit on a consistent basis, you must understand this: humans are led by emotions, and those emotions can cause the price of whatever you are trading to be very volatile—prices moving rapidly in multiple directions without a clearly identifiable reason.
Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account. Day Trading Disaster I didn't have any day trading experience when I first attempted to day trade in 2008, but I needed money. Earlier in this book I said needing money is a dangerous place to begin learning to trade because you have other financial problems that you need to learn to solve. Learning to trade is an important financial problem that you can learn to solve. If you believe it will be a way to get you out of your situation, you are mistaken.
However, I did not understand that truth at that early point in my trading career.
I started with a small $50 account using a strategy and style of trading that I learned from my first mentor, Michael Storm.
The strategy was excellent, and I was having a lot of early success. The problem is that I didn't understand trading emotions and how that moved markets and how my own trading emotions would motivate me to make trades.
This $50 kept growing despite my inexperience. I kept taking bigger risks and making more money. In a short period of time I had grown this $50 account to over $3,500!
I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.
That traumatic event was also my anchor for future success. Because even though it was devastating to me, I never forgot how I made that $3,500, and I always believed that if I did it once, I could do it again. That kept me going, always pushing forward. I also knew that the massive loss was because of my own reckless trading and did not have anything to do with the markets.
Despite the hard times, that memory of making that money allowed me to never quit. My friend and trading mentor Kevin Pyne from TradingBuddySystem.com, whom I interviewed on the How to Trade It podcast, taught me a great way to handle my emotions. He created a chart called the emotion tracker.3
Kevin explains that emotions can swing wildly, and we must be aware of them in our trading. He outlines these in Figure 3.1.
Each day before you trade, during trading, and after you trade you can review this chart and write down the words that describe what you are feeling. Then make sure you are not allowing these emotions to carry into your trades for that day. If you trade with your emotions, you will be erratic and you will be up and down in your trading, eventually causing failure. Figure 3.1 Emotions to Be Aware Of
SOURCE: TradingBuddySystem.com. The entire purpose of this is to help you understand that the market is moved by emotion and crowd mentality and if you understand this and you do not trade like the rest of the market, you will have a massive edge in your trading. Trapped Traders
One way to get an edge in trading is to think about what other traders are experiencing in the market. As we understand fear, greed, euphoria, and pain, we know that these are the real market movers. A sudden reversal at a key level can mean that there are trapped traders.
Trapped traders are traders who get into a trade because they think the market is breaking out, but instead of a breakout the market reverses and traps traders in a losing position. How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.
But not you! Because you have read this book and are working on your market mindset, you will be ready each day to approach the markets with level-headed trading tactics. Figure 3.2 Traders Enter on a Breakout but Get Trapped
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Markets Are Moved by Supply and Demand
Supply and demand is a natural law that is always true in nature. This law is what causes prices to move in the markets. If we understand how this works, it will enable us to get a better grasp on market movement, making us better and more accurate traders.
Specifically, “supply and demand” refers to the amount of goods and services available for people to buy, compared to the amount of goods and services people want to buy. If less of a product than the public wants is produced, the law of supply and demand says that more can be charged for the product. In other words, supply is the amount that is available. Demand is the desire for the product or service and the amount that people are willing to pay for it.
We see supply and demand happen all the time in our economy. In the documentary The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Episode 1: Sneakers,4 Jeff goes to Sneaker Con, a massive market for sneaker fanatics.
During the episode he shows what a massive demand can do to raise sneaker prices. A normal pair of shoes averages less than $100 a pair, but at this convention there are shoes that have massive resale value because of supply and demand—certain shoes are in limited supply combined with people who have money and are willing to pay. At the 2022 Sneaker Con there is a pair of Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force One that has an average resale price of $126,500.5
Supply and demand has always been the driving factor for price movements. Looking back in time, we can see the famous Dutch Tulip Market Bubble. This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary

Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account. Day Trading Disaster I didn't have any day trading experience when I first attempted to day trade in 2008, but I needed money. Earlier in this book I said needing money is a dangerous place to begin learning to trade because you have other financial problems that you need to learn to solve. Learning to trade is an important financial problem that you can learn to solve. If you believe it will be a way to get you out of your situation, you are mistaken.
However, I did not understand that truth at that early point in my trading career.
I started with a small $50 account using a strategy and style of trading that I learned from my first mentor, Michael Storm.
The strategy was excellent, and I was having a lot of early success. The problem is that I didn't understand trading emotions and how that moved markets and how my own trading emotions would motivate me to make trades.
This $50 kept growing despite my inexperience. I kept taking bigger risks and making more money. In a short period of time I had grown this $50 account to over $3,500!
I believed that I had made it—at this point I was making over $100 a day, and I truly believed that I had figured it out.
Can you guess what happened next?
I was afraid of missing a big move, and I got greedy. I increased the size on a trade, and then that trade started to move against me. Then the pain set in, and I couldn't close the trade because it was too painful. I never did have the courage to close the trade. The only way I got out was because of a margin call and that meant that the broker closes the trade because I didn't have any money left.
I was devastated. I worked hard for three months to build that balance up. Every single day slugging it out in the markets spending my time and energy to grow my account to over $3,500. I went from the emotion of invincibility to despair. I was devastated.
The aftereffects of that event were so harmful to me as a trader that I went on a massive downturn, a losing spiral where I continued to have losing week after losing week for six months after this event.
It was such a traumatic event that it created many psychological blocks in my mind that I had to work hard to free myself from.
That traumatic event was also my anchor for future success. Because even though it was devastating to me, I never forgot how I made that $3,500, and I always believed that if I did it once, I could do it again. That kept me going, always pushing forward. I also knew that the massive loss was because of my own reckless trading and did not have anything to do with the markets.
Despite the hard times, that memory of making that money allowed me to never quit. My friend and trading mentor Kevin Pyne from TradingBuddySystem.com, whom I interviewed on the How to Trade It podcast, taught me a great way to handle my emotions. He created a chart called the emotion tracker.3
Kevin explains that emotions can swing wildly, and we must be aware of them in our trading. He outlines these in Figure 3.1.
Each day before you trade, during trading, and after you trade you can review this chart and write down the words that describe what you are feeling. Then make sure you are not allowing these emotions to carry into your trades for that day. If you trade with your emotions, you will be erratic and you will be up and down in your trading, eventually causing failure. Figure 3.1 Emotions to Be Aware Of
SOURCE: TradingBuddySystem.com. The entire purpose of this is to help you understand that the market is moved by emotion and crowd mentality and if you understand this and you do not trade like the rest of the market, you will have a massive edge in your trading. Trapped Traders
One way to get an edge in trading is to think about what other traders are experiencing in the market. As we understand fear, greed, euphoria, and pain, we know that these are the real market movers. A sudden reversal at a key level can mean that there are trapped traders.
Trapped traders are traders who get into a trade because they think the market is breaking out, but instead of a breakout the market reverses and traps traders in a losing position. How do we know that this exists? I know because this has been me many times! I have been trapped in the past and will be trapped again.
I have enough experience in the markets to know when I get trapped and can close the trade with no emotion involved. I am able to do this so easily because of experience and because I look at trading in probabilities. I know that I am losing a trade now, but I will easily come back from that and win on the next trade if I follow my system and do proper money management. Knowing probability helps me to easily close the trade with a small loss. We will talk much more about probability in the money management section later on in this book.
Now we cannot know who is trapped or who is experiencing greed, but it has always been helpful to me to look at charts and think about what other traders are going through and what they might be thinking or doing (see Figure 3.2).
When we are calm and follow good money management and trade management, we will always come out ahead because we know that most traders are not able to do that. Most traders are ruled by emotions, which always ends with trading failure.
But not you! Because you have read this book and are working on your market mindset, you will be ready each day to approach the markets with level-headed trading tactics. Figure 3.2 Traders Enter on a Breakout but Get Trapped
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Markets Are Moved by Supply and Demand
Supply and demand is a natural law that is always true in nature. This law is what causes prices to move in the markets. If we understand how this works, it will enable us to get a better grasp on market movement, making us better and more accurate traders.
Specifically, “supply and demand” refers to the amount of goods and services available for people to buy, compared to the amount of goods and services people want to buy. If less of a product than the public wants is produced, the law of supply and demand says that more can be charged for the product. In other words, supply is the amount that is available. Demand is the desire for the product or service and the amount that people are willing to pay for it.
We see supply and demand happen all the time in our economy. In the documentary The World According to Jeff Goldblum, Episode 1: Sneakers,4 Jeff goes to Sneaker Con, a massive market for sneaker fanatics.
During the episode he shows what a massive demand can do to raise sneaker prices. A normal pair of shoes averages less than $100 a pair, but at this convention there are shoes that have massive resale value because of supply and demand—certain shoes are in limited supply combined with people who have money and are willing to pay. At the 2022 Sneaker Con there is a pair of Louis Vuitton Nike Air Force One that has an average resale price of $126,500.5
Supply and demand has always been the driving factor for price movements. Looking back in time, we can see the famous Dutch Tulip Market Bubble. This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes

Chapter 3How Markets Work: Knowing This Gives You an Edge This chapter explains how markets work and why markets move the way they do. This will give you a foundation of what is happening behind the scenes. This knowledge will assist you in doing the research you will need in preparing to enter your trading positions. Factors Responsible for Market MovementThe following list is just a small sample of the different factors that cause markets to move. Economic data and indicators: Market moves based on the release of economic data such as GDP, employment, inflation, and others.
Interest rates: Changes in interest rates set by central banks affect the cost of borrowing, which influences investment and spending. This increases money supply, which has a dramatic effect on market dynamics.
Global events and news: Market fluctuations can result from significant global events and news, such as natural disasters, political upheavals, and trade agreements.
Political and geopolitical developments: Market movements are impacted by political developments within countries and geopolitical relations between nations.
Supply and demand dynamics: Market prices are determined by the balance between supply and demand for goods and services.
Sentiment and investor behavior: Market movements can be influenced by the overall sentiment of investors and their collective actions.
Technological advancements: Technological breakthroughs can disrupt traditional market players and create new opportunities for growth.
Natural disasters and emergencies: Market fluctuations can occur as a result of natural disasters and emergencies, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and pandemics.
Central bank policies: Central banks can influence market movements through their monetary policies, such as setting interest rates or printing money.
Competition and market saturation: Market movements can be affected by competition within industries and the saturation of particular markets.
Emotions of traders: Fear and greed are massive factors that cause market movements. It is challenging to fully understand why markets move, as there are multiple factors at play, some of which may be unknown or unpredictable. Market movements are influenced by a combination of economic, political, social, and psychological factors, as well as by sudden events such as natural disasters or global emergencies.
Additionally, investor sentiment and behavior play a significant role in market movements, and it can be difficult to predict how individual investors or groups of investors will react in any given situation. Therefore, while it is possible to analyze and understand the general influences on market movements, it is impossible to predict with certainty why markets move.
Most traders do not learn about market mechanics in depth; by reading and understanding this chapter you will have an edge. In Chapter 1 I mentioned that one of the biggest obstacles traders face is thinking that they only need to know strategy and thus leave out many other important parts of market dynamics. This is a massive error in thinking and because of this most traders never learn the fundamental reason markets move the way they do.
We see “candles” on charts. We know that prices are going up or down, but we do not understand why or how these prices move. What makes a stock go down in value and how does it work?
I am going to share a concept that I first learned from Lance Beggs in YTC Price Action Trader1 that has been extremely helpful to me. Lance explains that the markets are moved by many factors that we cannot see. Things happen behind the scenes that we are not aware of. In fact, we only see the effect of market movements; we do not see the cause. We have an incomplete picture of the markets, and no matter how much information we have, we will never get the complete picture of why a market is moving.
Beggs uses the allegory of the cave from the Greek philosopher Plato. From Wikipedia: Imagine a cave where people have been imprisoned from childhood, but not from birth. These prisoners are chained so that their legs and necks are fixed, forcing them to gaze at the wall in front of them and not to look around at the cave, each other, or themselves. Behind the prisoners is a fire, and between the fire and the prisoners is a raised walkway with a low wall, behind which people walk carrying objects or puppets “of men and other living things.”
The people walk behind the wall so their bodies do not cast shadows for the prisoners to see, but the objects they carry do (“just as puppet showmen have screens in front of them at which they work their puppets”).The prisoners cannot see any of what is happening behind them, they are only able to see the shadows cast upon the cave wall in front of them. The sounds of the people talking echo off the walls, and the prisoners believe these sounds come from the shadows.
Socrates suggests that the shadows are reality for the prisoners because they have never seen anything else; they do not realize that what they see are shadows of objects in front of a fire, much less that these objects are inspired by real things outside the cave which they do not see.
The fire, or human-made light, and the puppets, used to make shadows, are done by the artists. Plato, however, indicates that the fire is also the political doctrine that is taught in a nation state. The artists use light and shadows to teach the dominant doctrines of a time and place.
Also, few humans will ever escape the cave. This is not some easy task, and only a true philosopher, with decades of preparation, would be able to leave the cave, up the steep incline. Most humans will live at the bottom of the cave, and a small few will be the major artists that project the shadows with the use of human-made light….2 There are too many people and circumstances involved in what moves a market, and when we begin to understand and accept this reality, we become equipped to learn how to profit from the markets.
There are major unknown factors that move markets that we cannot see. Understanding that you can never know everything in the markets will be freeing for you as a trader. This is freeing because if we truly understand that we will never be able to take a perfect trade, we will realize that trading is about probabilities. We take the best trade we can and use money management techniques to give us a trading edge. How Emotions Move Markets
I have discovered that having a strong understanding of the markets behind the scenes makes a big difference in how I look at trading and therefore has improved my trading performance.
The market movements we see happening on charts are caused by people buying and selling behind the scenes. All we see are prices going up or going down.
The market will not always make sense because it is being led by emotions. If you want to profit on a consistent basis, you must understand this: humans are led by emotions, and those emotions can cause the price of whatever you are trading to be very volatile—prices moving rapidly in multiple directions without a clearly identifiable reason.
Emotions can be irrational and erratic, which means that often the markets are irrational and erratic. If you do not understand that this is happening in the markets, you can easily get caught up in the market movement, and it can cause a great deal of damage to your account balance.
It is easy for traders to get caught in the emotions of the market. If you start following along, you begin trading purely emotionally and then you are contributing to the chaos of the market. Please be aware of your emotions so that if you get caught up trading emotionally, you will stop before you lose your trading capital.
The two emotions that cause the markets to move are fear and pain. Fear is one of the strongest emotions that a trader must learn to overcome to be successful, and it is one of the most powerful forces involved in causing market prices to move.
Fear can be caused by greed: you are afraid that you will be missing out on the next big trade. This is called FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).
It works like this: you see that the market is making a large price move, and you are on the sidelines. Because you fear missing a massive profit, you enter in a massive trade, which is way bigger than the amount of risk you would normally take. However, because you are being led by fear you did not think much about the risk; you just jumped in with a larger size than you should have.
Being controlled by greed and fear causes many traders to make terrible trading decisions, and that is one of the biggest reasons for the massive market moves we see happening on a daily basis.
Pain is felt when a trader loses more money than they can mentally handle. This then causes additional irrational decisions because a trader isn't thinking about trading properly but just ending the pain of being in such a massive losing trade. In the previous example of fear, the trader entered a trade that was too risky. That trader will be in pain. If the market reverses, they now have to deal with a massive loss. That trader might then make additional bad decisions, perhaps refusing to close the trade because they hope that it will turn around.
You might get lucky, and the price might turn around and then you get out of that massive losing trade because you were in too much pain and couldn't bear to take that large of a loss.
This is what I call being rewarded for bad behavior. Sometimes the market will reward a trader for bad behavior. That reinforces the bad behavior, and they will continue to trade in fear and continue to make too-large trades. Eventually, the consequences of negative trading catch up to them, and they have to close the trade with massive losses, or they end up taking a trade so large that they lose their entire trading account.

This story can help us understand how markets work and also give us greater understanding that will help us become better traders. Figure 3.3 When Demand Dries Up, Price Rapidly Falls
SOURCE: https://www.history.com/news/tulip-mania-financial-crash-holland. In Holland in 1634 the Dutch discovered that tulips could grow 10 times faster from a bulb than from a seed, creating extremely high demand for bulbs. The price started to go up, and as the price went up people had a greater desire to get these bulbs. Why was the demand so high? Because of fear and greed, people wanted to make money, and they would buy the bulbs. Their fear of missing out on the potential profit created massive demand.6
Then, when prices started to stall, people again became afraid that prices were going to drop. Then they couldn't sell fast enough,, and the demand dropped and the price dropped much faster than it had risen (see Figure 3.3). Identify Supply and Demand on Charts
Supply and demand can be seen on trading charts, which can be used to help traders find entries by utilizing this powerful law of nature. The first way to identify supply and demand is to use price levels. Figure 3.4 The Arrows Show Support Levels
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. The levels are called “support” and “resistance.” They are created when price changes direction. Support happens when the price has been moving lower, then stops going down, reverses, and begins to climb. The area where price changed direction is a support level (see Figure 3.4).
Resistance occurs where supply and demand have driven the price above the current price. If price is moving up and then stops and changes direction, the area where price reverses is called resistance (see Figure 3.5).
These levels are very important because they show you at what price the supply and demand are located. This causes price to react at those levels because traders create supply and demand at those levels.
Traders all over the world can see these levels displayed on their charts. They will put buy and sell orders based on these levels. The buy and sell orders are what create the supply and demand. Figure 3.5 The Arrows Show Resistance Points
SOURCE: Casey Stubbs. Anytime we can clearly see support and resistance levels on our charts, we know that there will be orders accumulating when those levels occur.
This is important to understand because it helps us know when to get into the market ahead of time. Being aware of these levels will help you know when to enter and exit a trade. Stock Markets Have the Same Behavior as Traditional Markets
Have you ever been to a crowded Saturday morning market where people are waiting in line to get some of the most important items? Maybe you can remember going to an auction and bidding on that item you had to have.
I remember the first time I went to an auction. They had a 2000 Dodge Neon for $500 starting bid. I thought, are you kidding me, this car would cost at least $3,000!
I got excited and started to bid right away because I wanted to get this car so cheap. I think that might have been a bit of greed to get me started because I wanted the deal. Next thing I know I am in a bidding war with someone, and the price is moving up fast. I stopped caring about the deal, and I just wanted the car because this other bidder was trying to take my car away from me!
Again more emotions—the emotion of wanting to win, the competitive spirit kicks in, and I lose my logic.
At some point in the competition for winning the prize, someone's bankroll will give out, and they won't pay the price, and then the bidding stops. When the bidding slows down or stops, the winning side will continue to bid and drive the price to the next area of orders.
Have you ever been in a situation like that?
What about when you are trading? Trading prices in a market move just like in an auction: people are bidding, and buyers and sellers are putting in bids and offers to take control of the price. These pricing battles often occur around areas of support and resistance because of supply and demand. Many traders believe that this area is too expensive, and prices go down. Many others believe it is cheap, and prices will go up.
Eventually one side will lose the bidding, and price will break away from the area and move in a clear direction. Just like when I was buying the Neon, buyers or sellers will run out of capital or conviction and give up, and the price will move in one clear direction. Use the Magnet for Your Benefit
Price can be compared to a magnet. A magnet works by producing a magnetic field. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of electrons in the magnet, creating north and south poles. When a magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material, the electrons align in the same direction, resulting in the material becoming magnetized. This magnetic field can then attract or repel other magnets or magnetic materials. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the type of material and the arrangements of the electrons. Something similar happens in markets.
Price is drawn like a magnet to where the buyers and sellers are ready to make trades. What this means is that price is attracted to the prices where the orders are located. To understand this, I'll briefly explain how “stop losses” and “take profits” work. Definition of Stop Loss
A stop loss is an order to sell your trade for a loss at a point at which you believe you were wrong about the trade. Stop loss means you stop losing money. Using stop losses is something that a successful trader always does.
This keeps your losses small and allows you to continue to trade. If you do not use a stop loss, you can experience catastrophic losses that can end your trading career.
Stop losses are an important concept to understand about how markets move and work. Because stop losses are so important, most traders are using them to limit risk on their trading accounts. Definition of Take Profit
A take profit is an order that a trader sets to automatically close a position when a certain profit level has been reached. In other words, it's a way to lock in profits when the price of an asset reaches a predetermined level.
Having a take profit order is important in trading because it helps to manage risk. By setting a take profit, a trader can limit their potential losses and ensure they capture a portion of the profits made on a trade.
It also takes the emotion out of the equation, as the trader does not have to manually close the position and can instead focus on other trades. In addition, take profit orders can help traders stick to their trading plan and avoid making impulsive decisions that could negatively impact their profits.
Now that we know what stop loss orders and take profit orders are, we can begin to realize that where those stops and take profits are. There will be a large number of orders at that price level. That is what price is drawn to—the areas where there are a large number of orders.
This is a huge edge for us to understand because we can use the price magnet effect to help us get a probability edge in our trading.
If there is a price battle around a key support or resistance level, all of the buyers and sellers at that level finish trading. Some traders hit their take profit; other traders hit the stop loss. Some traders get fearful and finally close the trade. Stop Losses and Take Profits Create Massive Order Flow
The location of these stop losses is usually put at supply and demand levels, also known as support and resistance. Because all of these stop losses are set near the same price, most of them trigger at the same point. When this happens, the buyers and sellers slow down trading and volume dries up. Volume is the amount of shares or transactions that are taking place during a specific period of time.
Trading volume and order flow can be called liquidity. These are all different words to describe the same thing: buyers and sellers changing hands. This is important for traders to understand because the market needs a large number of buyers and sellers to push prices to new levels.
At each support or resistance level, there is a battle between buyers and sellers to determine whether price is going to continue to go up or reverse. This battle is decided by the number of buyers or sellers. When the battle for a level is decided and the liquidity or order flow is dried up, the price will move to the next level, looking for where there is a large block of buyers and sellers.
Price will move like a magnet to the next level. Nature abhors a vacuum: when there are no orders, price gets sucked right to the area on the charts where there are orders stacked. Then price will continue in that process all over again, and that is how the markets work. This happens many times a day in many markets all over the world, and we as traders know this and wait for the process to happen; then we take advantage of it to trade for profit. Summary
This chapter explores the complex and dynamic world of markets and how they function. Understanding the factors that drive market movements is crucial for investors, traders, and market participants. Factors Responsible for Market Movement: Many factors can impact the movement of markets, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and changes in supply and demand. It is important to stay informed about these factors and how they can influence market trends.
How Emotions Move Markets: Emotions play a significant role in market movements, with fear and greed often driving market behavior. Traders must be mindful of their emotions and strive to make rational, data-driven decisions.
How Supply and Demand Works: The movement of prices in markets is driven by the balance between supply and demand. When demand is high and supply is low, prices tend to rise. Conversely, when demand is low and supply is high, prices tend to fall.
Stock Markets Are the Same as Traditional Markets: The principles of supply and demand are the same in stock markets as they are in traditional markets, such as commodities or real estate. In both cases, price moves like a magnet toward supply and demand levels. Markets are complex systems that are influenced by a variety of factors, including economic indicators, emotions, and supply and demand. To succeed in the markets, it is important to understand these factors and how they impact market behavior. By staying informed and making data-driven decisions, traders can navigate the markets with confidence and achieve their investment goals. Notes
