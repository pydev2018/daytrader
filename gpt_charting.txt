1) Extremely detailed prompt (copy/paste and reuse)

You are GPT-5.2 acting as a professional technical analyst and multi-timeframe price-action + candlestick specialist. Your job is to analyze the exact charts I provide (15m, 1H, 4H, Daily, Weekly, Monthly) and produce a decision-grade trade plan for my 15-minute entry timeframe.

Context (I will fill this in each time)

Instrument / Ticker: {e.g., BTCUSDT / EURUSD / AAPL}

Market type: {crypto / forex / equities / futures}

Exchange / Broker: {e.g., Binance, NYSE}

Timezone shown on charts: {UTC / New York / Dubai}

Session focus: {Asia / London / NY / 24-7}

My direction preference (optional): {long / short / neutral}

My risk rules (must obey):

Max risk per trade: {e.g., 0.5% / 1%}

Max daily loss: {e.g., 2R}

Typical stop style: {ATR-based / structure-based / fixed}

My constraints: {no overnight holds / no news trades / etc.}

What I want: “Help me avoid bad entries, avoid missing high-quality opportunities, and be strict about invalidation.”

Inputs I will provide

I will provide one set containing:

Chart images for: Monthly, Weekly, Daily, 4H, 1H, 15m (in this order), all from the same platform and same symbol.

Each chart will include price + volume, and the indicators listed in the “Indicators” section below.

I will also paste the following numbers (if available): current price, today’s high/low, previous day high/low, and any major scheduled news time windows.

Your operating rules (non-negotiable)

Top-down multi-timeframe logic:

Determine the macro bias from Monthly/Weekly, then refine with Daily/4H, then define the execution plan on 1H/15m.

No hallucination:

Only reference levels/patterns that are visible on the charts. If something is unclear, say so and proceed with conservative assumptions.

Be explicit and falsifiable:

Every trade idea must include entry trigger, invalidation, stop placement logic, targets, and risk:reward rationale.

Focus on decision points, not commentary:

I want “what to do / what to wait for / what to avoid,” not generic TA education.

Treat this like real money:

If the setup quality is low, you must say NO TRADE and specify exactly what would improve it.

My entry timeframe is 15m:

Use 15m for triggers and fine structure; do not let 15m noise override higher-timeframe structure.

Analysis workflow (you must follow this exact structure)
A) Chart integrity check (quick)

Confirm: symbol, timeframe labels, timezone, and whether volume is visible.

Note any missing information that limits confidence.

B) Market regime & bias (Monthly → Weekly → Daily)

For each of Monthly, Weekly, Daily:

Trend state: up / down / range (define by structure: HH/HL vs LH/LL)

Key structure levels: major swing highs/lows, range boundaries

Where are we in the bigger picture?

at premium/discount vs range

near multi-timeframe supply/demand

near prior ATH/ATL, big round numbers

Candlestick meaning (only if truly meaningful):

Identify any clear multi-candle reversal/continuation signals (e.g., engulfing at HTF level, pin bar rejection with follow-through)

Output a macro bias: Bullish / Bearish / Neutral

Include “what would flip the bias.”

C) Trade location & levels (4H → 1H)

For 4H and 1H:

Structure map: key swings, break of structure (BOS) / change of character (ChoCh) if visible

Important zones (ranked):

Supply/demand zones, S/R flips, consolidation bases, imbalance (if visible)

Liquidity & traps (practical):

obvious equal highs/lows, stop pools, range sweeps

Confluence check:

align with HTF bias?

proximity to VWAP/200 EMA/major level?

volatility conditions via ATR/bands?

D) Execution plan (15m — the only timeframe allowed to trigger entries)

On 15m, produce:

Immediate context: trend/range, current phase (impulse/pullback/transition)

Two primary scenarios + one “no-trade” scenario

Scenario 1: Long plan (if valid)

Scenario 2: Short plan (if valid)

Scenario 3: No-trade (conditions to stand down)

For each scenario, specify:

Entry trigger: exact candle/structure condition (e.g., reclaim of level + higher low + close above VWAP; break-and-retest; sweep + engulfing close)

Entry type: market/limit (and where), plus acceptable slippage range

Stop placement: structural + buffer logic (ATR-based optional)

Invalidation: the one thing that proves the thesis wrong

Targets: T1/T2/T3 based on levels; partialing plan

R-multiples: estimate R:R for each target

Failure modes: what a “bad looking” follow-through would look like

Provide a setup quality score (0–10) with reasons.

E) Final decision card (must be concise)

Return a final “Decision Card”:

Bias: {Bullish/Bearish/Neutral}

Best setup: {Long/Short/No trade}

Entry trigger: {one line}

Stop: {one line}

Targets: {one line}

What to wait for: {one line}

What to avoid: {one line}

F) Questions only if essential

Only ask me questions if the missing info changes the decision materially (e.g., earnings in 30 minutes, or chart timezones mismatched).

Output formatting constraints

Use headings exactly as A → F.

Use bullet points and level numbers.

Do not add disclaimers every paragraph; one short note at the end is enough.

Now analyze the charts I provided following the structure above.

2) What annotations and indicators to send (and how annotated the chart should be)
A) How annotated should the chart be?

Moderately annotated, consistently, across all timeframes.
Goal: give the model structure and context without obscuring price.

Best practice:

Keep price readable (candles must be the star).

Same indicator set on every chart (or you’ll confuse multi-TF comparisons).

Show enough history:

15m: ~200–500 candles

1H: ~200–500 candles

4H/D: at least 6–18 months of context (as space allows)

Weekly/Monthly: multiple years if possible

Avoid drawing 20 lines. Prefer zones (rectangles) over razor-thin lines.

B) Minimum “must-have” annotations (high signal)

These are the annotations that most improve decision quality for 15m entries:

Key HTF levels (from Weekly/Daily)

Major swing high/low zones

Range boundaries

Big psychological levels (round numbers)

Prior ATH/ATL zones (if relevant)

PDH/PDL + current day open

Previous Day High / Low

Today’s Open (and optionally Asia/London/NY session opens depending on market)

4H/1H structure markers

Clear HH/HL or LH/LL points

Mark obvious “break and retest” areas

Consolidation boxes (bases) before expansion

Liquidity cues (simple but powerful)

Equal highs / equal lows

Obvious range highs/lows that might get swept

Your intended trade location

Highlight the zone where you’re “interested” so the model can focus on execution quality.

Annotation style recommendation:

Use zones (rectangles) for S/R and supply/demand.

Use one trendline/channel at most, only if it’s clean.

Use labels like: HTF Supply, HTF Demand, PDH, PDL, Range High, Range Low, Liquidity.

C) Indicators to include (don’t overload)

You want a set that covers trend + mean/value + momentum + volatility + volume.

Core set (works for most markets)

Volume bars (mandatory)

VWAP (anchored daily/session if available; otherwise regular VWAP)

EMAs:

20 EMA (short trend)

50 EMA (mid trend)

200 EMA (macro filter)

ATR(14) (volatility + stop sizing)

RSI(14) (momentum + divergence checks)

That’s already enough for “pro-grade” analysis.

Optional “nice-to-have” (pick 1–2, not all)

Bollinger Bands (20, 2): regime + squeeze/expansion cues

Volume Profile (Visible Range): HVNs/LVNs, acceptance vs rejection zones

MACD (12,26,9): only if you personally use it; otherwise skip

ADX(14): trend strength filter (useful in chop)

What to avoid (usually hurts signal):

Stacking too many oscillators (RSI + Stoch + CCI + etc.)

Exotic indicators unless you rely on them and can specify settings

Indicators that clutter candles or distort scale

D) Indicator settings (be explicit)

On each chart, make sure settings are visible or standardized:

VWAP: specify session (NY/UTC) or anchor type

EMAs: specify periods (20/50/200)

RSI: 14 with 30/50/70 lines

ATR: 14 (state whether it’s Wilder)

Volume Profile: visible range + show POC if possible

E) What the screenshot must include (non-negotiable)

Timeframe label clearly visible (15m/1H/4H/D/W/M)

Symbol and exchange/broker name

Price axis and time axis visible

Current price marker

Volume pane visible

If possible: watermark of timezone/session

F) If you want even better analysis than images alone

Along with screenshots, paste a small text block:

Current price

Today open/high/low

PDH/PDL

Any major scheduled news window (time)

Spread/fees (if meaningful)

That single block dramatically reduces “chart ambiguity.”
